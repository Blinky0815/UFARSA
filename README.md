# UFARSA
This repository contains the Matlab codes implementing the UFARSA (Ultra-fast Accurate Reconstruction of Spiking Activity). UFARSA is a novel, heuristic model-free-type method which enables an ultra-fast, accurate, near-automatic reconstruction of spiking activities from noisy calcium imaging data. UFARSA has been introduced in this paper (submitted on December 2017): 

“**Ultra-Fast Accurate Reconstruction of Spiking Activity from Calcium Imaging Data**”; Vahid Rahmati, Knut Kirmse, Knut Holthoff, Stefan J. Kiebel.

You can readily setup and then apply UFARSA to your recorded fluorescence traces (time-courses); please see the **User_Guide.pdf** and the two **demo scripts** in this repository.
