# UFASAR
This repository contains the Matlab codes implementing the UFASAR (Ultra-fast Accurate Spiking Activity Reconstruction). UFASAR is a novel, heuristic model-free-type method which enables an ultra-fast, accurate, near-automatic reconstruction of spiking activities from noisy calcium imaging data. UFASAR has been introduced in this paper (submitted on December 2017): 

“Ultra-Fast Accurate Spiking Activity Reconstruction from Noisy Calcium Imaging Data”; Vahid Rahmati, Knut Kirmse, Knut Holthoff, Stefan J. Kiebel.

You can readily setup and then apply UFASAR to your recorded fluorescence traces (time-courses); please see the User_Guide.pdf file in this repository.
